The *impresso* project's main [OBJECTIVE](https://impresso-project.ch/project/objectives/) is to develop a media monitoring suite for historical newspapers driven by research objectives in computational linguistics, history and design.

From a [COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS PERSPECTIVE](https://impresso-project.ch/project/linguistics/), we carried out the semantic indexation of huge volumes of scanned texts via the adaption and application of a variety of natural language processing techniques, allowing humanities scholars to understand and interpret their contents. From a [HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE](https://impresso-project.ch/project/history/), the driving question was how such semantic enrichments could support search and discovery of sources and their critical analysis. For the [DESIGN TEAM](https://impresso-project.ch/project/design/) finally, this created the challenge to develop a public-facing interface which integrates the semantic enrichments in novel search and discovery workflows.
