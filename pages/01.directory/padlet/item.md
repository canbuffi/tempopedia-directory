Padlet is like paper for your screen. Start with an empty page and then put whatever you like on it. Upload a video, record an interview, snap a selfie, write your own text posts or upload some documents, and watch your padlet come to life. Once others add to it, the page will update in real time.

Used by teachers, students, professionals, and individuals of all ages, all around the world, the Padlet app is the easiest way to create and collaborate wherever you are. Padlet supports any file type you can imagine, from Spotify Playlists to Excel Spreadsheets. Upload a link and watch a detailed preview appear. Organize the content in any format you like - whether you prefer an grid of images or a chronological scroll.
